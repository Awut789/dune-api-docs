## Dune for Teams
Did you know that you can create a team account on Dune? With Dune for Teams, you can benefit from a shared workspace, making collaboration on content creation a breeze. Additionally, team accounts provide access to exclusive plus/premium features and provide enhanced privacy for your content.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the essentials of setting up and managing a team on Dune.

## Setting Up a Team
1. Navigate to the global context switcher.
2. Select “Create new team”.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the team creation process.

<Note>Every account on Dune, be it individual or team-based, requires a unique identifier or slug. This means you cannot establish a new team using a handle that's already in use.</Note>

## Inviting Members & Assigning Roles

- Once your team is set up, you'll have the opportunity to invite others. Click on “Invite People” and proceed as directed.
- During the invitation process, you can assign one of three roles to the invitee: [admin, editor, or viewer](/query-app/web-app/teams).
- Alternatively, use the provided URL to invite members.
