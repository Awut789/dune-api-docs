## Table description

This table represents the blocks in the Aptos blockchain. A block is a collection of transactions, and is identified by a unique block identifier. Each block contains a timestamp and a reference to the previous block hash, forming a chain of blocks. The block structure is crucial for the blockchain's integrity and security, ensuring a verifiable and tamper-evident ledger.
