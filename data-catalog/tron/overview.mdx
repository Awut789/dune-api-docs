Raw data tables are very useful for getting transactions, pre and post-balances, and instructions data. As a non-EVM chain, Tron Raw data looks quite different from other chains (largely due to its account structure). You can learn to get started with Tron analysis [in this guide](https://web3datadegens.substack.com/p/starter-guide-to-tron-data-analysis).

However, queries that have been written using raw data tables are notoriously hard to understand and audit due to the nature of the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Furthermore, the raw data tables have a very large number of rows and hence can be slow to query. Most of the time you are better off working with [decoded data](/data-catalog/tron/idl-tables) from IDL decoding.
