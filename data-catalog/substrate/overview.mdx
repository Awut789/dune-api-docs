description: Polkadot enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens.
---

Polkadot, designed as a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain blockchain, aims to address the limitations of previous blockchain technologies by enabling different blockchains to co-exist and communicate within a secure shared system. The platform introduces a sophisticated governance model where all DOT token holders can participate in decision-making. Polkadot optimizes both security and decentralization compared to traditional Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) systems. Polkadot include  the platform's hybrid consensus protocol, validity and availability mechanisms, and Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP) feature, which facilitates secure and orderly inter-parachain communication.

You can learn more about Polkadot by visiting the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/).
