title: Daily Token Balances on EVM Networks
sidebarTitle: "Daily Balances"
description: "Comprehensive daily records of token balances for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) addresses, covering native currencies and various token standards." 
---

The `tokens_ethereum.balances` section meticulously catalogs daily token balances across all addresses on EVM-compatible networks. This dataset encompasses:

- **Native currency balances** (such as ETH, MATIC)
- **ERC-20 token balances**
- **ERC-721 (NFT) balances**
- **ERC-1155 token balances**

### Utility

Leveraging the balances tables equips analysts and developers with a foundational dataset for diverse applications, enabling you to:

- **Evaluate token distribution patterns**
- **Identify leading token holders**
- **Track token movement across addresses**
- **Examine an address's token portfolio**
- **Review multi-signature wallet holdings**

and much more, offering a granular view into the dynamics of token economics.

### Network Coverage

The current scope of our tables includes these notable networks:

- Arbitrum
- Base 
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Optimism

We are continually expanding our coverage to include additional networks. 

### Balance Calculation Methodology

Our approach to storing balances is the following: We calculate and store token balances for each address on a daily basis. This process involves querying the blockchain for the balance of each address at the end of the day. The balance is then stored in the `tokens_ethereum.balances` table, which is updated daily. In order for the balance to be queried, the address must have appeard in any of the following tables:

- **For native currencies**: **Transactions** and **traces** ``to``/``from`` addresses, Ethereum-specific **withdrawals**, and block mining/validator activities.
- **For ERC20**: Analysis is based on token transfer events detailed in the [tokens_ethereum_base_transfers.sql](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/blob/main/models/_sector/tokens/ethereum/tokens_ethereum_base_transfers.sql).
- **For ERC721 and ERC1155**: Inspection of NFT transfer activities via the [nft_ethereum_transfers.sql](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/blob/main/models/_sector/nft/transfers/chains/nft_ethereum_transfers.sql), focusing on the `to`/`from` addresses.

These dependencies on transfer and NFT event tables introduce a delay to balance updates, contingent on the latency inherent in the Spellbook's processing.

This also means that if an address has not been involved in any of the above activities, its balance will not be updated.
This might be the case for non-standard erc20 contracts that do not emit the `Transfer` event, or for addresses that have not been involved in any transactions or NFT transfers. If there is a specific token that does not emit the `Transfer` event, but has a different event for token transfers, please let us know and we will see if we can include it in our balance calculations.
