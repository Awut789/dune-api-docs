## Table description

This table leverages direct calls to nodes to query for the balance of smart contracts and the native tokens. This approach ensures accuracy and eliminates the potential discrepancies associated with relying on aggregated historical data. 
The retrieved information is consolidated into a single table, offering a unified view of various token types and their corresponding balances at a designated block number.

You can use this table to query the balances of native tokens, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens at a specific block number.
