title: Instruction Calls
---

This is an unnested table of [`solana.transactions`](transactions.md). There can be multiple instructions in a transaction, so having an exploded view here will make it a little easier to work with the data. **This table mainly exists as the base for [Solana decoded tables](../../decoded/solana/idl-tables.md) though, which you should be using instead.**

Here is the schema:

| Column Name               | Data Type     | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| block_slot | bigint | This block’s slot index in the ledger |
| block_date | date | Event date |
| block_time | timestamp(3) with time zone | Event time |
| block_hash | varchar | The hash of this block, base-58 encoded
| index | integer | the order of the instruction in the original instructions of the transaction |
| tx_index | integer | Index into the block’s transactions |
| outer_instruction_index | integer | Index of the instruction in `instructions`. Starts from 1 |
| inner_instruction_index | integer | Index of the instruction in `inner_instructions`. Starts from 1 |
| outer_executing_account | varchar | The account key of the program that executed this instruction at the outer level |
| inner_executing_account | varchar | The account key of the program that executed this instruction at the inner level (sometimes null) |
| executing_account | varchar | coalesce of the inner_executing_account and outer_executing_account. The account key of the program that executed this instruction |
| data | varbinary | Program input data in a base-58 string |
| is_inner | boolean | marks if a row is an inner instruction or not |
| account_arguments | array(varchar) | Ordered list of accounts to pass to the program |
| inner_instructions | array(row(data varchar, executing_account varchar, account_arguments array(varchar))) | see breakout below |
| tx_signer | varchar | The address that initiates the transaction and pays the transaction fee |
| tx_id | varchar | the first signature in the transaction |
| tx_success | boolean |The transaction was valid and thus committed. |
| log_messages | `array<string>` | The log messages emitted by the transaction |

**inner\_instructions**

| Field              | Data type      | Description                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| account\_arguments | array&lt;string&gt; | Ordered list of accounts to pass to the program                |
| data               | string         | Program input data in a base-58 string                         |
| executing\_account | string         | The account key of the program that executed this instruction. |
