title: Materialized Views
description: This feature in DuneSQL allows you to schedule a query and save it's results as a table, to be used in another query. This powerful functionality enables you to take the query view feature even further.
---

## Overview

The "Materialized View" feature in DuneSQL allows you to use an existing query's results in another query. This powerful functionality enables you to break down bigger queries so that the complex/high compute logic only has to run a few times a day, and the queries you build on top run much faster.

You have full control over this view, you can think of it as a simplified Spellbook table. You should think of using this feature any time you run into:

1. Query timeouts (running longer than 30 mintes)
2. Stage limits (exceeding stage limits in the planning stage, normally happens when you join too many tables)
3. Memory limits (exceeding the memory limits, normally happens when you use too many large tables like `solana.transactions` or `ethereum.traces`)

## To create a materialized view
Write a new query or go to an existing query. (We suggest creating via team context on a plan with sufficient credits)

1. Make sure all columns are explicitly named
2. Save the query
3. After saving a “materialize” button will appear below the run button.
4. Click the materialize button, and set a refresh schedule. Each refresh uses up credits based on cluster used.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/NWga8JMv0LWkB7toRngC?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}

  />
</div>

You can find the example query [here](https://dune.com/queries/2858381), and it can be queried with just:

```
SELECT 
*
FROM dune.dune.result_2858381
```

Some key things to keep in mind: 

1. A query result has a 200MB limit in the editor but a materialized view doesn’t have storage limits. Even though the results will look truncated in the editor.
2. This materialized view refresh schedule is DIFFERENT from the query scheduler. Results from running the query or the normal query scheduler will NOT update the materialized view. 
3. Plans have total monthly storage limits (for premium plans, it’s 50GB, plus it’s 15GB, free is 1MB).
4. You can delete your materialized view by archiving it. This works via the setting dialogue on the query page.
   
## To query a materialized view

Wait for a materialized view to finish creation first. It should be roughly similar to the time the query normally takes to execute - maybe a bit longer due to time it takes to write the new table.

Query the materialized view via `dune.<username>.result_<queryId>` (displayed in modal)
If your username starts with a number, you’ll need to wrap the \<username> in quotes i.e. `dune.”123co”.result567`

Eventually, you can query by the materialized view name specified during the materialized view creation flow but that doesn’t work yet.

<tip>  When you query a materialized view in another query, it does not rerun the materialized view (unlike query views). </tip>  

**Matviews are marked separately in your query list and can also be filtered on.**
