Welcome to Dune, where we have created the perfect experience for querying blockchain data. Our platform consists of two main parts, the **Dune Web App** and the **Query Engine**, each designed to cater to your data needs in a unique and powerful way.

The **Dune Web App** is your interface to the full power of dune's capabilities. Search for tables, create queries and visualize the results in a user-friendly environment. The **Query Engine** is the core of Dune, where you can write complex SQL queries to extract and analyze blockchain data.

Together, the Dune Web App and the Query Engine provide a seamless experience for querying blockchain data, enabling you to extract the information you need to make informed decisions.
## Dune Web App

The Dune Web App is an intuitive, user-friendly interface designed to bring the expansive world of blockchain data to your fingertips. It is the visual layer that allows you to interact with the data in an accessible way, enabling you to:

- **Create Queries**: Use the Query Editor to craft SQL queries that extract the data you need for analysis.
- **Visualize Data**: Create and customize charts and dashboards with various graphical tools to make data easy to understand and actionable.
- **Collaborate**: Work together with team members, share your findings, and access shared insights from the Dune community.
- **Create and Share Reports**: Generate reports and visualizations that can be shared with stakeholders to inform decision-making.

## Query Engine

Querying for data on Dune is powered by **DuneSQL**, a custom-built query engine designed for efficient analysis of blockchain data. 
DuneSQL is a fork of [TrinoSQL](https://trino.io/), which is an open-source, distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes.

Key features of our Query Engine include:

- **Special data types**: Query blockchaind data while maintaining maximum speed and precision.
- **Parquet format**: Whether you query megabytes or petabytes of data, the Parquet format ensures that your queries are fast and efficient.
- **Extensive custom functions**: We have built a wide range of custom functions to make your queries more powerful and efficient.
- **Data management**: Create and manage your own data pipelines by creating views and materialized views on the fly.
